<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The Prior Design and Royalty Agreements are hereby superseded and terminated in their
entirety. This Agreement shall govern the continuing relationship between DESIGNER and CLIENT with
respect to all design services performed by DESIGNER for CLIENT from and after the Effective Date,
except as may be mutually agreed and evidenced in a writing signed by the Parties. CLIENT and
DESIGNER each hereby releases the other and their respective managers, members, officers,
directors, representatives, trustees, shareholders, and beneficiaries from any and all claims,
demands, charges, complaints, causes of action, suits, liabilities, obligations, promises,
agreements, controversies, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs
actually incurred) of any kind or nature whatsoever, fixed or contingent, known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected (each a “Claim” and collectively the “Claims”) arising out of the Prior
Design and Royalty Agreements, except for (i)&nbsp;any accrued and unpaid royalties by CLIENT to
DESIGNER, and (ii)&nbsp;unrecouped royalty advances.
</div>


<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Each of CLIENT and DESIGNER hereby waives with respect to the other party and its

beneficiaries (the “Released Parties”) all rights under California Civil Code Section&nbsp;1542, which
reads as follows:

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%"><b>“A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing
the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor.”</b>

full and complete discharge of each of the Released Parties, CLIENT and DESIGNER each expressly
acknowledges that the release contained herein is intended to include in its effect, without
limitation, all Claims that such party does not now know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
time of execution hereof, and that the general release contemplates the extinguishment of such
Claim or Claims.

</div>


<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. During the term of this Agreement, DESIGNER shall not knowingly perform Services for any

</div>


<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. For as long as DESIGNER is prohibited from performing Services in the Exclusive Field for
any third party pursuant to the first sentence of Section&nbsp;3.b., CLIENT’S engagement of DESIGNER to
provide the Services shall be exclusive in the Exclusive Field, and neither CLIENT nor its
Affiliates shall directly or indirectly engage any third party to perform Services to or for the
benefit of CLIENT or its Affiliates in the Exclusive Field.
</div>


<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event DESIGNER actually

Control of CLIENT or Parent which has not been approved by Client’s or Parent’s Board of Directors,
DESIGNER may, upon ten (10)&nbsp;days’ prior written notice to CLIENT,
terminate the restrictions set forth in Section&nbsp;3.b. with respect to DESIGNER’S provision of
Services in the Exclusive Field. In the event of such termination of restrictions by DESIGNER,

its reasonable discretion.

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. All Intellectual Property which has been heretofore or is hereafter prepared, conceived or
developed by DESIGNER hereunder, either solely by DESIGNER or jointly with CLIENT personnel or
others, including but not limited to documents, product specifications and designs, blueprints,
sketches, notes, reports, data, models, samples and project plans and all improvements and
modifications (collectively, “Materials”) shall, if in existence on the date hereof, as between
CLIENT and DESIGNER, be the sole and exclusive property of CLIENT and, if prepared or created
hereafter, shall thereupon become, as between CLIENT and DESIGNER, the sole and exclusive property
of CLIENT when prepared or created hereunder, whether or not actually used by CLIENT. Upon request
of CLIENT, all Materials shall be promptly delivered to CLIENT together with any Materials
furnished to DESIGNER by CLIENT. DESIGNER hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys and delivers to
CLIENT all of its worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Materials and all patents and
trade secrets attendant thereto. DESIGNER agrees to do all things, including executing all
documents, at CLIENT’S request, reasonably required to vest in CLIENT title to the rights hereunder
assigned, conveyed and delivered.
</div>

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In furtherance of the foregoing, DESIGNER agrees that any copyrightable materials created in
connection with Products under this Agreement constitute “work made for hire,” as defined in 17
U.S.C. Section&nbsp;101, and that any copyrights arising from DESIGNER’S services hereunder, whether the
property of CLIENT as “work for hire” or by assignment hereunder, shall remain the exclusive
property of CLIENT, except <i>as </i>otherwise provided herein. If it is determined pursuant to the
copyright laws of the United States that the Materials produced hereunder, or any portion
thereof, are not a “work made for hire,” then DESIGNER hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys and
delivers all of its right, title and interest therein and thereto (including, without limitation,
all copyrights and extensions and renewals thereof) to CLIENT and agrees to execute and deliver to
CLIENT (at CLIENT’S expense), whether during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, any
instruments reasonably required by CLIENT to confirm its ownership thereof.

responsible for, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to, apply for, seek, prosecute,
obtain, maintain and renew all patents, copyrights or trademarks, whether in the United States or
in foreign jurisdictions, which may relate to the Products, designs or other Materials created

assist and cooperate with CLIENT in connection with CLIENT’S efforts to apply for, seek, prosecute,
obtain or renew any such patent, copyright or trademark. DESIGNER shall execute such documents as
CLIENT reasonably requests in connection therewith, and DESIGNER hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints CLIENT and its officers, and each of them, to act as DESIGNER’S agent and attorney-in-fact

hereunder. CLIENT shall be solely responsible for all expenses and costs which CLIENT may incur or
which may be incurred by DESIGNER at CLIENT’S request in filing for and obtaining any patents,

DESIGNER of such decision, provided, that (i)&nbsp;notice not to file an application shall be delivered

discretion, prosecute and maintain such patent and patent applications owned by CLIENT, in CLIENT’S
name and on CLIENT’S behalf, but at DESIGNER’S cost and expense. CLIENT agrees to cooperate with
DESIGNER in connection with such prosecution and maintenance. Any election by DESIGNER to
prosecute and maintain such patents and patent applications owned by CLIENT shall not affect
CLIENT’S ownership and rights to use any patents and patent applications owned by CLIENT under this
Agreement.

thereof by the non-breaching Party, said Party may, at its option, and in addition to any other
remedies that it may be entitled to, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to such
effect prior to a curing of the breach; provided, however, that any such termination shall not

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The services provided hereunder will be performed in a timely and professional manner by
Robert J. Mills or other qualified personnel reasonably approved by CLIENT. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event of the death or mental or physical disability of the principal of Designer,
CLIENT shall remain obligated to pay Royalties as provided in the Agreement.
</div>


<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. DESIGNER will use its commercially reasonable efforts to support CLIENT’S efforts to
develop any Product designs delivered hereunder to meet applicable
standards or requirements set forth by ANSI/BIFMA and all applicable standards or requirements
on flammability, ergonomics, light reflectivity and indoor air quality. CLIENT acknowledges that
it shall be CLIENT’S responsibility to test any such Product to assure compliance with such
standards. DESIGNER shall have no responsibility with respect to the failure of any Product to
meet such standards, other than the obligation to continue to provide Services hereunder in
accordance with the terms hereof until CLIENT has determined that the Product complies with such
standards.

after the last sale of any Product, CLIENT shall obtain and maintain, or otherwise be covered by,
product liability and errors and omissions insurance (whether directly or through policies
maintained by an Affiliate), with coverage of at least $5,000,000 in the aggregate and $1,000,000

that such policy shall not be canceled or modified without at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior written

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. CLIENT may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder without the prior
written approval of DESIGNER, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that CLIENT may assign this Agreement in connection with any merger or sale of all or
substantially all of its business; provided, further, however, that nothing herein shall limit the
ability or authority of the CLIENT to license to any third party that is not an Affiliate of CLIENT
anywhere in the world any of the designs or other Intellectual Property designed or developed
hereunder. To the extent any such license (other than a license granted to an Affiliate of CLIENT)
is granted in respect of sales of Products (or with respect to Borrowed Design Elements, products)
outside of the United States, CLIENT shall notify DESIGNER of the terms thereof, and DESIGNER shall
be entitled to ten percent (10%) of any royalty actually received by CLIENT in consideration for
the license of designs or other Intellectual Property
designed or developed hereunder. To the extent any such license (other than a license granted
to an Affiliate of CLIENT) is granted in respect of sales in the United States, CLIENT shall notify
DESIGNER of the terms thereof, and DESIGNER shall be entitled to receive from CLIENT the Royalties
in respect of such sales by the licensee or any applicable sublicense set forth in Section&nbsp;9
(Royalties and Payments). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that CLIENT enters into any
such license to a third party and also sells to such third party any parts or components included
in the Products, the price paid for such parts or components shall be subject to royalties under
Section&nbsp;9.a. hereof, and shall not be subject to the 10% license royalty under this Section&nbsp;20.a.
Any allocation by CLIENT of consideration received from such third party between the purchase price
for parts and components sold by CLIENT and the royalty for the license provided by CLIENT shall be
reasonable, taking into account the price charged by CLIENT for such parts or components or similar
products to other customers.

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Without limiting the foregoing, and except with respect to a license by CLIENT contemplated
by Section&nbsp;20.a. above, in the event that CLIENT sells, assigns or otherwise transfers to a third
party CLIENT’S right, title or interest in or to any Intellectual Property rights relating to or
included in any Product, CLIENT shall require that such third party
